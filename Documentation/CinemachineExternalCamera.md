# Cinemachine Follow Zoom

This Cinemachine [extension](CinemachineVirtualCameraExtensions.html) adjusts the FOV of the lens to keep the target object at a constant size on the screen, regardless of camera and target position.

## Properties:

| **Property:** | **Function:** |
|:---|:---|
| __Width__ | The shot width to maintain, in world units, at target distance. The FOV will be adjusted so that an object of this size, at target distance, will fill the screen. |
| __Damping__ | Increase this value to soften the responsiveness of the follow-zoom. Small numbers make the camera more responsive. Larger numbers make the camera respond more slowly.  |
| __Min FOV__ | Lower limit for the FOV that this behavior generates. |
| __Max FOV__ | Upper limit for the FOV that this behavior generates. |
