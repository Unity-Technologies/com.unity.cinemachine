### CinemachineBrain

_Type:_ class

_Namespace:_ Cinemachine

_Inherits:_ MonoBehaviour


CinemachineBrain is the link between the Unity Camera and the Cinemachine Virtual Cameras in the scene.  It monitors the priority stack to choose the current Virtual Camera, and blend with another if necessary.  Finally and most importantly, it applies the Virtual Camera state to the attached Unity Camera.

The CinemachineBrain is also the place where rules for blending between virtual cameras are defined.  Camera blending is an interpolation over time of one virtual camera position and state to another.  If you think of virtual cameras as cameramen, then blending is a little like one cameraman smoothly passing the camera to another cameraman.  You can specify the time over which to blend, as well as the blend curve shape.  Note that a camera cut is just a zero-time blend.

### CinemachineClearShot

_Type:_ class

_Namespace:_ Cinemachine

_Inherits:_ CinemachineVirtualCameraBase

_Implements:_ ICinemachineCamera


Cinemachine ClearShot is a "manager camera" that owns and manages a set of Virtual Camera gameObject children.  When Live, the ClearShot will check the children, and choose the one with the best quality shot and make it Live.

This can be a very powerful tool.  If the child cameras have CinemachineCollider extensions, they will analyze the scene for target obstructions, optimal target distance, and other items, and report their assessment of shot quality back to the ClearShot parent, who will then choose the best one.  You can use this to set up complex multi-camera coverage of a scene, and be assured that a clear shot of the target will always be available.

If multiple child cameras have the same shot quality, the one with the highest priority will be chosen.

You can also define custom blends between the ClearShot children.

The composer will look at a point where it estimates the target will be this many seconds into the future.  Note that this setting is sensitive to noisy animation, and can amplify the noise, resulting in undesirable camera jitter.  If the camera jitters unacceptably when the target is in motion, turn down this setting, or animate the target more smoothly. |

### CinemachineFramingTransposer

_Type:_ class

_Namespace:_ Cinemachine

_Inherits:_ CinemachineComponentBase


This is a Cinemachine Component in the Body section of the component pipeline.  Its job is to position the camera in a fixed screen-space relationship to the vcam's Follow target object, with offsets and damping.

The camera will be first moved along the camera Z axis until the Follow target is at the desired distance from the camera's X-Y plane.  The camera will then be moved in its XY plane until the Follow target is at the desired point on the camera's screen.

The FramingTansposer will only change the camera's position in space.  It will not re-orient or otherwise aim the camera.

For this component to work properly, the vcam's LookAt target must be null.  The Follow target will define what the camera is looking at.

If the Follow target is a CinemachineTargetGroup, then additional controls will be available to dynamically adjust the camera's view in order to frame the entire group.

Although this component was designed for orthographic cameras, it works equally well with persective cameras and can be used in 3D environments.

### CinemachineOrbitalTransposer

_Type:_ class

_Namespace:_ Cinemachine

_Inherits:_ CinemachineTransposer


This is a CinemachineComponent in the the Body section of the component pipeline.  Its job is to position the camera in a variable relationship to a the vcam's Follow target object, with offsets and damping.

This component is typically used to implement a camera that follows its target.  It can accept player input from an input device, which allows the player to dynamically control the relationship between the camera and the target, for example with a joystick.

The OrbitalTransposer introduces the concept of __Heading__, which is the direction in which the target is moving, and the OrbitalTransposer will attempt to position the camera in relationship to the heading, which is by default directly behind the target.  You can control the default relationship by adjusting the Heading Bias setting.

If you attach an input controller to the OrbitalTransposer, then the player can also control the way the camera positions itself in relation to the target heading.  This allows the camera to move to any spot on an orbit around the target.

### CinemachineTrackedDolly

_Type:_ class

_Namespace:_ Cinemachine

_Inherits:_ CinemachineComponentBase


A Cinemachine Virtual Camera Body component that constrains camera motion to a CinemachinePath.  The camera can move along the path.

This behaviour can operate in two modes: manual positioning, and Auto-Dolly positioning.  In Manual mode, the camera's position is specified by animating the Path Position field.  In Auto-Dolly mode, the Path Position field is animated automatically every frame by finding the position on the path that's closest to the virtual camera's Follow target.

#### Properties


| _Name_ | _Type_ | _Description_ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IsValid** | Boolean | _[Get]_ True if component is enabled and has a path. |
| **Stage** | Stage | _[Get]_ Get the Cinemachine Pipeline stage that this component implements.  Always returns the Body stage.<br>_Possible Values:_<br>- **Body**<br>- **Aim**<br>- **Noise**<br>- **Finalize**<br> |


#### Fields

| **m_PositionUnits** | PositionUnits | How to interpret Path Position.  If set to Path Units, values are as follows: 0 represents the first waypoint on the path, 1 is the second, and so on.  Values in-between are points on the path in between the waypoints.  If set to Distance, then Path Position represents distance along the path.<br>_Possible Values:_<br>- **PathUnits**<br>- **Distance**<br>- **Normalized**<br> |
| **m_PathOffset** | Vector3 | Where to put the camera relative to the path position.  X is perpendicular to the path, Y is up, and Z is parallel to the path.  This allows the camera to be offset from the path itself (as if on a tripod, for example). |
| **m_XDamping** | Single | How aggressively the camera tries to maintain its position in a direction perpendicular to the path.  Small numbers are more responsive, rapidly translating the camera to keep the target's x-axis offset.  Larger numbers give a more heavy slowly responding camera.  Using different settings per axis can yield a wide range of camera behaviors. |
| **m_YDamping** | Single | How aggressively the camera tries to maintain its position in the path-local up direction.  Small numbers are more responsive, rapidly translating the camera to keep the target's y-axis offset.  Larger numbers give a more heavy slowly responding camera.  Using different settings per axis can yield a wide range of camera behaviors. |
| **m_ZDamping** | Single | How aggressively the camera tries to maintain its position in a direction parallel to the path.  Small numbers are more responsive, rapidly translating the camera to keep the target's z-axis offset.  Larger numbers give a more heavy slowly responding camera.  Using different settings per axis can yield a wide range of camera behaviors. |
| **m_CameraUp** | CameraUpMode | How to set the virtual camera's Up vector.  This will affect the screen composition, because the camera Aim behaviours will always try to respect the Up direction.<br>_Possible Values:_<br>- **Default**: Leave the camera's up vector alone.  It will be set according to the Brain's WorldUp.<br>- **Path**: Take the up vector from the path's up vector at the current point.<br>- **PathNoRoll**: Take the up vector from the path's up vector at the current point, but with the roll zeroed out.<br>- **FollowTarget**: Take the up vector from the Follow target's up vector.<br>- **FollowTargetNoRoll**: Take the up vector from the Follow target's up vector, but with the roll zeroed out.<br> |
| **m_PitchDamping** | Single | How aggressively the camera tries to track the target rotation's X angle.  Small numbers are more responsive.  Larger numbers give a more heavy slowly responding camera. |
| **m_YawDamping** | Single | How aggressively the camera tries to track the target rotation's Y angle.  Small numbers are more responsive.  Larger numbers give a more heavy slowly responding camera. |
| **m_RollDamping** | Single | How aggressively the camera tries to track the target rotation's Z angle.  Small numbers are more responsive.  Larger numbers give a more heavy slowly responding camera. |
| **m_AutoDolly** | AutoDolly | Controls how automatic dollying occurs.  A Follow target is necessary to use this feature. |

#### Fields


| _Name_ | _Type_ | _Description_ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **m_Enabled** | Boolean | If checked, will enable automatic dolly, which chooses a path position that is as close as possible to the Follow target.  Note: this can have significant performance impact. |
| **m_PositionOffset** | Single | Offset, in current position units, from the closest point on the path to the follow target. |
| **m_SearchRadius** | Int32 | Search up to how many waypoints on either side of the current position.  Use 0 for Entire path. |
| **m_SearchResolution** | Int32 | We search between waypoints by dividing the segment into this many straight pieces.  The higher the number, the more accurate the result, but performance is proportionally slower for higher numbers. |



### CinemachineTransposer

_Type:_ class

_Namespace:_ Cinemachine

_Inherits:_ CinemachineComponentBase


This is a CinemachineComponent in the Body section of the component pipeline.  Its job is to position the camera in a fixed relationship to the vcam's Follow target object, with offsets and damping.

### CinemachineVirtualCamera

_Type:_ class

_Namespace:_ Cinemachine

_Inherits:_ CinemachineVirtualCameraBase

_Implements:_ ICinemachineCamera


This behaviour is intended to be attached to an empty Transform GameObject, and it represents a Virtual Camera within the Unity scene.

The Virtual Camera will animate its Transform according to the rules contained in its CinemachineComponent pipeline (Aim, Body, and Noise).  When the virtual camera is Live, the Unity camera will assume the position and orientation of the virtual camera.

A virtual camera is not a camera.  Instead, it can be thought of as a camera controller, not unlike a cameraman.  It can drive the Unity Camera and control its position, orientation, lens settings, and PostProcessing effects.  Each Virtual Camera owns its own Cinemachine Component Pipeline, through which you provide the instructions for dynamically tracking specific game objects.

A virtual camera is very lightweight, and does no rendering of its own.  It merely tracks interesting GameObjects, and positions itself accordingly.  A typical game can have dozens of virtual cameras, each set up to follow a particular character or capture a particular event.

A Virtual Camera can be in any of three states:

* **Live**: The virtual camera is actively controlling the Unity Camera.  The virtual camera is tracking its targets and being updated every frame. 
* **Standby**: The virtual camera is tracking its targets and being updated every frame, but no Unity Camera is actively being controlled by it.  This is the state of a virtual camera that is enabled in the scene but perhaps at a lower priority than the Live virtual camera. 
* **Disabled**: The virtual camera is present but disabled in the scene.  It is not actively tracking its targets and so consumes no processing power.  However, the virtual camera can be made live from the Timeline.

The Unity Camera can be driven by any virtual camera in the scene.  The game logic can choose the virtual camera to make live by manipulating the virtual cameras' enabled flags and their priorities, based on game logic.

In order to be driven by a virtual camera, the Unity Camera must have a CinemachineBrain behaviour, which will select the most eligible virtual camera based on its priority or on other criteria, and will manage blending.

#### Properties

### LensSettings

_Type:_ struct

_Namespace:_ Cinemachine


Describes the FOV and clip planes for a camera.  This generally mirrors the Unity Camera's lens settings, and will be used to drive the Unity camera when the vcam is active.

#### Fields


| _Name_ | _Type_ | _Description_ |
| --- | --- | --- |

### NoiseSettings

_Type:_ class

_Namespace:_ Cinemachine

_Inherits:_ ScriptableObject


This is an asset that defines a noise profile.  A noise profile is the shape of the noise as a function of time.  You can build arbitrarily complex shapes by combining different base perlin noise frequencies at different amplitudes.

The frequencies and amplitudes should be chosen with care, to ensure an interesting noise quality that is not obviously repetitive.

As a mathematical side-note, any arbitrary periodic curve can be broken down into a series of fixed-amplitude sine-waves added together.  This is called fourier decomposition, and is the basis of much signal processing.  It doesn't really have much to do with this asset, but it's super interesting!

#### Properties

| --- | --- | --- |
| **PositionNoise** | TransformNoiseParams[] | _[Get]_ Gets the array of positional noise channels for this NoiseSettings. |
