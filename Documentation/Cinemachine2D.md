Cinemachine supports orthographic cameras. When you set the Unity camera’s projection to Orthographic, Cinemachine adjusts to accommodate it.  In Virtual Camera properties for __Lens__, __FOV__ is replaced by __Orthographic Size__.  Note that settings related to FOV and certain FOV-oriented behaviors such as [Follow Zoom](CinemachineFollowZoom.html) have no effect if the camera is orthographic.

In orthographic environments, it doesn’t usually make sense to rotate the camera.  Accordingly, Cinemachine offers the [Framing Transposer](CinemachineBodyFramingTransposer.html) to handle framing and composition without rotating the camera.
