  - Inherit Position checkbox to ensure smooth positional handoff from outgoing camera
  - OnCameraLive event gets fired when the camera activates.  Useful for custom handlers.
- Added ScreenSpaceAimWhenTargetsDiffer as a vcam blend hint.  This influences what happens when blending between vcams with different LookAt targets
- Increased stability of vcams with very small FOVs
- Framing Transposer no longer requires LookAt to be null
- LensSettings Aspect, Orthographic, IsPhysicalCamera, SensorSize properties no longer internal
- Noise Profiles: don't magically create assets.  Prompt user for filename and location of new or cloned profiles
- Refactored interaction between timeline and CM brain, to improve handling of edge cases (fogbugz case 1048497)
- Bugfix: StateDrivenCamera Editor was not finding states if target was OverrideController
- Bugfix when dragging orbital transposer transform: take bias into account
- Bugfix: SaveDuringPlay was not handling asset fields correctly - was sometimes crushing assets
- Bugfix: SimpleFollow transposers were not initilizing their position correctly at game start
- Bugfix: Timeline with CM shot was causing jitter in some FixedUpdate situations
- Bugfix: Multiple brains with heterogeneous update methods were not behaving correctly.  CM will now support this, but you must make sure that the brains have different layer masks.
- Example scenes now include use of CinemachineTriggerAction script.  

## [2.1.13] - 2018-05-09
### Removed dependency on nonexistant Timeline package, minor bugfixes
- Bugfix: Custom Blends "Any to Any" was not working (regression)
- Bugfix: Composer was sometimes getting wrong aspect if multiple brains with different aspect ratios
- Bugfix: could not drag vcam transforms if multiple inspectors and one is hidden
- Bugfix: Framing Transposer initializes in the wrong place - noticeable if dead zone

## [2.1.12] - 2018-02-26
### Storyboard, Bugfixes and other enhancements.  Also some restructuring for Package Manager

- New option to specify vcam position blend style: linear, spherical, or cylindrical, based on LookAt target
- Added API to support seamless position warping of target objects: OnTargetObjectWarped().
- Added support for custom blend curves
- Lookahead: added Ignore Y Axis Movement option
- Added support for cascading blends (i.e. blending from mid-blend looks better)
- POV/Orbital/FreeLook axis: exposed Min, Max, and Wrap in the UI, for customized axis range
- FreeLook: added Y Axis recentering
- POV: Added recentering feature to both axes
- Path: Added Normalized Path units option: 0 is start of path, 1 is end.
- Path: added length display in inspector
- Timeline Clip Editor: vcam sections are now collapsible
- API enhancement: added Finalize to Pipeline stages, called even for manager-style vcams
- Bugfix: PostProcessing V2 DoF blending works better
- Bugfix: OrbitalTransposer works better with WorldUp overrides
- Bugfix: Remove StateDrivenCamera "not playing a controller" warning
- Bugfix: Handle exceptions thrown by assemblies that don't want to be introspected
- Bugfix: vcams following physics objects incorrectly snapped to origin after exiting play mode
- Bugfix: predictor now supports time pause
- Bugfix: Moved StartCoroutine in Brain to OnEnable()
- Bugfix: Collider was causing problems in Physics on Android platforms
- Bugfix: dragging a vcam's position updtaes prefabs properly
- Bugfix: All extension now respect the "enabled" checkbox
- Bugfix: Undo for Extasion add will no longer generate null references

## [2.1.10] - 2017-11-28
### This is the first UPM release of *Unity Package Cinemachine*.

- Perlin Noise component: added inspector UI to clone or locate existing Noise profiles, and to create new ones
- Noise Presets were moved outside of the Examples folder
- Example Assets are now included as embedded package, not imported by default
- Bugfix: FreeLook with PositionDelta was not properly updating the heading
- Bugfix: Transitioning between FreeLooks simetimes caused a short camera freeze
- Bugfix: Added some null checks to FreeLook, to prevent error messages at build time

## [2.1.9] - 2017-11-17
### Initial version.
