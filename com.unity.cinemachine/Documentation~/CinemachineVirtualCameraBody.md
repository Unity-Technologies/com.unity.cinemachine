# Position Control

Use the Position Control behaviors to specify the algorithm that moves the CinemachineCamera in the Scene. To rotate the camera, set the [Rotation Control](CinemachineVirtualCameraAim.md) behaviors.

Cinemachine includes these behaviors for moving a CinemachineCamera:

- [__None__](CinemachineBodyDoNothing.md): Does not procedurally move the Camera.
- [__Follow__](CinemachineFollow.md): Moves in a fixed relationship to the __Tracking Target__.
- [__Orbital Follow__](CinemachineOrbitalFollow.md): moves in a variable relationship to the __Tracking Target__, optionally accepting player input.
- [__Third Person follow__](CinemachineThirdPersonFollow.md): Pivots the camera horizontally and vertically around the player, with the pivot point at the __Tracking Target__, following the rotation of the tracking target.
- [__Position Composer__](CinemachinePositionComposer.md): Moves in a fixed screen-space relationship to the __Tracking Target__.
- [__Hard Lock to Target__](CinemachineHardLockToTarget.md): Uses the same position as the __Tracking Target__.
- [__Spline Dolly__](CinemachineSplineDolly.md): Moves along a predefined path, specified by a Spline.
