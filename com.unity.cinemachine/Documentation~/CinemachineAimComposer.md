# Composer

This Virtual Camera __Aim__ algorithm rotates the camera to face the __Look At__ target. It also applies offsets, damping, and composition rules. Examples of targets for aiming: the upper spine or head bone of a character, vehicles, or dummy objects which are controlled or animated programmatically.

## Properties:

| **Property:** | **Function:** |
|:---|:---|
| **Center On Activate** | Forces the camera to the center of the screen when the camera becomes live. |
| **Tracked Object Offset** | Offset from the center of the Look At target, in target-local space. Fine-tune the tracking target position when the desired area is not the tracked objectâ€™s center. You can also use [Scene Handles](handles.md) to modify this property. |
| __Lookahead Time__ | Adjust the offset based on the motion of the Look At target. The algorithm estimates the point that the target will be this many seconds into the future. This feature is sensitive to noisy animation. It can amplify the noise, resulting in undesirable camera jitter. If the camera jitters unacceptably when the target is in motion, turn down this property or animate the target more smoothly. |
| __Lookahead Smoothing__ | Controls the smoothness of the lookahead algorithm. Larger values smooth out jittery predictions and increase prediction lag. |
| __Lookahead Ignore Y__ | Toggle to ignore movement along the Y axis for lookahead calculations. |
| __Horizontal Damping__ | How responsively the camera follows the target in the screen-horizontal direction. Use small numbers for more responsive, rapid rotation of the camera to keep the target in the dead zone. Use larger numbers for a more heavy, slowly-responding camera.  |
| __Vertical Damping__ | How responsively the camera follows the target in the screen-vertical direction. Use different vertical and horizontal settings to give a wide range of camera behaviors. |
| __Screen X__ | Horizontal screen position for the center of the dead zone. The camera rotates so that the target appears here. |
| __Screen Y__ | Vertical screen position for target. The camera rotates so that the target appears here. |
| __Dead Zone Width__ | The width of the screen region within which the camera ignores any movement of the target. If the target is positioned anywhere within this region, the Virtual Camera doesn't update its rotation. This is useful for ignoring minor target movement.  |
| __Dead Zone Height__ | The height of the screen region within which the camera ignores any movement of the target. If the target is positioned anywhere within this region, the Virtual Camera doesn't update its rotation. This is useful for ignoring minor target movement. |
| __Soft Zone Width__ | The width of the soft zone. If the target appears in this region of the screen, the camera will rotate to push it back out to the dead zone, in the time specified by the Horizontal Damping setting. |
| __Soft Zone Height__ | The height of the soft zone. If the target appears in this region of the screen, the camera will rotate to push it back out to the dead zone, in the time specified by the Vertical Damping setting. |
| __Bias X__ | Positions the soft zone horizontally, relative to the dead zone. |
| __Bias Y__ | Positions the soft zone vertically, relative to the dead zone. |
