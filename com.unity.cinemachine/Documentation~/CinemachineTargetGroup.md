# Cinemachine Target Group

Use Cinemachine Target Group to treat multiple GameObjects as a single Look At target. Use a Target Group with the [Group Composer](CinemachineAimGroupComposer.md) algorithm.

To create a Virtual Camera with a Target Group:

1. In the Unity menu, choose __GameObject > Cinemachine > Target Group Camera__. <br/>Unity adds a new Virtual Camera and Target Group to the Scene. The __Follow__ and __Look At__ targets in the Virtual Camera refer to the new Target Group.

2. In the [Hierarchy](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html), select the new Target Group object.

3. In the [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html), click the + sign to add a new item to the group.

4. In the new item, assign a GameObject (you can drag and drop from the Hierarchy), and edit the __Weight__ and __Radius__ properties.

5. To add more GameObjects to the Target Group, repeat steps 3-4.
