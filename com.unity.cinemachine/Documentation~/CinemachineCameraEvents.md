# Cinemachine Camera Events

When Cinemachine Cameras are activated, global events are sent via CinemachineCore.  Scripts can add listeners to those events and take action based on them.  Listeners will receive events for all cameras.

Sometimes it's desirable to have events sent only for a specific camera, so that scripts can be notified based on this specific camera's activity without having to provide code to filter the events.  The Cinemachine Camera Events component fills this need.

If you add it to a CinemachineCamera, it will expose events that will be fired based on that camera's activity.  Any listeners you add will be called when the events happen for that camera.

If you want to attach events to a CinemachineBrain, please see [Cinemachine Brain Events](CinemachineBrainEvents.md).
