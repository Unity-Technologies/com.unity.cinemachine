# Hard Look At

This CinemachineCamera __Rotation Control__ behaviour rotates the camera to keep the __Look At__ target in the center of the camera's frame.  Optionally, an offset can be specified in order to look at a point that is offset from the LookAt target's origin.
This is useful for looking at a character's head, or some other point of interest.

### Properties
