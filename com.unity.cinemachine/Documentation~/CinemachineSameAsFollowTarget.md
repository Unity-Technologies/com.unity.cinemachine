# Same As Follow Target

This CinemachineCamera __Rotation Control__ behavior matches the orientation of the __Tracking__ target. When used with the [Hard Lock To Target](CinemachineHardLockToTarget.md) behavior from [Position Control](ProceduralMotion.md#position-control), the result is to make the CinemachineCamera match the path and rotation of a control GameObject.
