## Tutorials

[A "Using Cinemachine" series of video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) is available online in Unity's official YouTube channel. Discover various Cinemachine use cases and watch the immediate effects resulting from the corresponding project setup.

> [!NOTE]
> These videos have been made with a previous version of Cinemachine. You might notice a few changes in the interface and the naming of some elements, but all the explained concepts and shown functionality still apply to the latest Cinemachine version.

| Video | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6Q5sKXjZOM&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Keep a camera focused on a Transform and follow it as it moves around in the Scene. |
| [Track & Dolly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fkx94vHtg&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Track targets by setting paths for the Cinemachine Cameras to move between. |
| [State Driven Cameras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X00qXErxIM&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Link Cinemachine Cameras to animation states and further customize their behavior in the Scene. |
| [Free Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X33t13gOBFw&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Create an orbital camera system with input from the player and maintain control of the camera composition at different orbit stages. |
| [Clear Shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9w-agFYZ3I&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Dynamically cut between Cinemachine Cameras in the Scene as a tracked target is occluded. |
| [Post Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFqOEvrVZeE&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | With the addition of the post-processing stack, Cinemachine allows to blend easily between different effects on the cameras or in the Scene. |
| [Cinemachine 2D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWqX8GxeCBk&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Use Cinemachine composition tools with an orthographic virtual camera in a 2D Project. |
