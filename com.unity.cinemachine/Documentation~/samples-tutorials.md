# Samples and tutorials

Several sample scenes and video tutorials are available in addition to this documentation to demonstrate how to use the Cinemachine features in real-world scenarios.

## Samples

The Cinemachine package includes sample scenes that you can [import to your project](samples-import.md) to discover many Cinemachine features in different contexts of use.

| Sample | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2D Samples | Sample scenes illustrating various ways to use Cinemachine in a 2D setting.<br />Includes: `2D Fighters`, `2D Platformer`, `CameraMagnets`. |
| 3D Samples | Sample scenes illustrating various ways to use Cinemachine in a 3D setting.<br />Includes: `Brain Update Modes`, `ClearShot`, `Custom Blends`, `Cutscene`, `FreeLook Deoccluder`, `FreeLook on Spherical Surface`, `Impulse Wave`, `Lock-on Target`, `MixingCamera`, `RunningRace`, `SplitScreenCar`, `ThirdPersonWithAimMode`, `ThirdPersonWithRoadieRun`. |
| Input System Samples | Sample scenes illustrating various ways to use Cinemachine with the input system.<br />Includes: `Split Screen Multiplayer`. |

### Simple Player Controller

Several of the samples listed above make use of Cinemachine's [Simple Player Controller](SimplePlayerController.md), a basic but versatile player controller that you can use in your own projects. It is a suite of scripts that you can combine and configure to create character controllers which you can use in different contexts to implement several types of character movement.

## Tutorials

[A "Using Cinemachine" series of video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) is available online in Unity's official YouTube channel. Discover various Cinemachine use cases and watch the immediate effects resulting from the corresponding project setup.

> [!NOTE]
> These videos have been made with a previous version of Cinemachine. You might notice a few changes in the interface and the naming of some elements, but all the explained concepts and shown functionality still apply to the latest Cinemachine version.

| Video | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6Q5sKXjZOM&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Keep a camera focused on a Transform and follow it as it moves around in the Scene. |
| [Track & Dolly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fkx94vHtg&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Track targets by setting paths for the Cinemachine Cameras to move between. |
| [State Driven Cameras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X00qXErxIM&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Link Cinemachine Cameras to animation states and further customize their behavior in the Scene. |
| [Free Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X33t13gOBFw&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Create an orbital camera system with input from the player and maintain control of the camera composition at different orbit stages. |
| [Clear Shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9w-agFYZ3I&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Dynamically cut between Cinemachine Cameras in the Scene as a tracked target is occluded. |
| [Post Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFqOEvrVZeE&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | With the addition of the post-processing stack, Cinemachine allows to blend easily between different effects on the cameras or in the Scene. |
| [Cinemachine 2D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWqX8GxeCBk&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0TQpl4JdfEDNO1xK_I34y8P) | Use Cinemachine composition tools with an orthographic virtual camera in a 2D Project. |
