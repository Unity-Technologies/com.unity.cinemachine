Create dramatic or subtle cuts or blends, for example:

* For a cutscene where two characters exchange dialog, use three Cinemachine Cameras: one camera for a mid-shot of both characters, and separate Cinemachine Cameras for a close-up of each character. Use Timeline to synchronize audio with the Cinemachine Cameras.

* Duplicate an existing Cinemachine Camera so that both Cinemachine Cameras are in the same position in the Scene. For the second Cinemachine Camera, change the FOV or composition. When a player enters a trigger volume, Cinemachine blends from the first to the second Cinemachine Camera to emphasize a change in action.
