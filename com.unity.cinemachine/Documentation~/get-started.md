# Get started with Cinemachine

<!--- This page is a landing page for getting started --->

<!--- The purpose of the section is to explain the essentials and give quick instructions to get into the mechanics with basic functional results. --->

<!--- It should give a minimum of context about the level of info the whole section provides. --->

<!--- Also include a table linking to all next level sub-pages, with short descriptions. --->

Create dramatic or subtle cuts or blends, for example:

* For a cutscene where two characters exchange dialog, use three Cinemachine Cameras: one camera for a mid-shot of both characters, and separate Cinemachine Cameras for a close-up of each character. Use Timeline to synchronize audio with the Cinemachine Cameras.

* Duplicate an existing Cinemachine Camera so that both Cinemachine Cameras are in the same position in the Scene. For the second Cinemachine Camera, change the FOV or composition. When a player enters a trigger volume, Cinemachine blends from the first to the second Cinemachine Camera to emphasize a change in action.
