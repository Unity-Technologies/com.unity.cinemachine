# Cinemachine Handle toolbar

The Cinemachine Handle toolbar is a group of 3D controls that allow you to manipulate virtual camera parameters visually in the Scene view. You can use the handle tools to interactively adjust the selected object's parameters quickly and efficiently rather than typing numbers into the inspector.

## Activating and deactivating the toolbar

To activate the Handle toolbar:

* Right-click on the **Scene** tab in the Scene view.
* Select **Overlays** and then **Cinemachine** from the pop-up menu.

The Cinemachine Handle toolbar appears as shown above.
* Select any Handle tool from the toolbar.
* The corresponding Handle then appears in the Scene view.
* You can then select the Handle again to deactivate it from the Scene view.

## Handle tools

The following four Handle tools are available in the toolbar:

1. **Field of View (FOV)**

The camera view in vertical degrees. You can drag the points to increase or decrease the horizontal or vertical FOV.

For more information on the Field of View (FOV) property see, [Setting Virtual Camera properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.8/manual/CinemachineVirtualCamera.html).

2. **Far/Near clip planes**

* You can drag the center line to change position while maintaining the distance between the far clip and near clip plane.
* You can also drag the points to increase the far clip plane and near clip plane.

For more information on the Far and Near clip plane properties see, [Setting Virtual Camera properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.8/manual/CinemachineVirtualCamera.html).

3. **Follow offset**

The offset is the camera's position in the world. Follow offset moves in a straight line but follows the camera. You can drag the points to increase or decrease the Follow offset position.

For more information on the Follow offset property see, [Orbital Transposer properties](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.8/manual/CinemachineBodyOrbitalTransposer.html).

4. **Tracked object offset**

This starts from where the camera is placed. You can drag the points to increase or decrease the tracking target position when the desired area isn't the tracked objectâ€™s center.
