    /// This behaviour is intended to be attached to an empty Transform GameObject,
    /// and it represents a Virtual Camera within the Unity scene.
    ///
    /// The Virtual Camera will animate its Transform according to the rules contained
    /// in its CinemachineComponent pipeline (Aim, Body, and Noise).  When the virtual
    /// camera is Live, the Unity camera will assume the position and orientation
    /// of the virtual camera.
    ///
    /// A virtual camera is not a camera. Instead, it can be thought of as a camera controller,
    /// not unlike a cameraman. It can drive the Unity Camera and control its position,
    /// orientation, lens settings, and PostProcessing effects. Each Virtual Camera owns
    /// its own Cinemachine Component Pipeline, through which you provide the instructions
    /// for dynamically tracking specific game objects.
    ///
    /// A virtual camera is very lightweight, and does no rendering of its own. It merely
    /// tracks interesting GameObjects, and positions itself accordingly. A typical game
    /// can have dozens of virtual cameras, each set up to follow a particular character
    /// or capture a particular event.
    ///
    /// A Virtual Camera can be in any of three states:
    ///
    /// * **Live**: The virtual camera is actively controlling the Unity Camera. The
    /// virtual camera is tracking its targets and being updated every frame.
    /// * **Standby**: The virtual camera is tracking its targets and being updated
    /// every frame, but no Unity Camera is actively being controlled by it. This is
    /// the state of a virtual camera that is enabled in the scene but perhaps at a
    /// lower priority than the Live virtual camera.
    /// * **Disabled**: The virtual camera is present but disabled in the scene. It is
    /// not actively tracking its targets and so consumes no processing power. However,
    /// the virtual camera can be made live from the Timeline.
    ///
    /// The Unity Camera can be driven by any virtual camera in the scene. The game
    /// logic can choose the virtual camera to make live by manipulating the virtual
    /// cameras' enabled flags and their priorities, based on game logic.
    ///
    /// In order to be driven by a virtual camera, the Unity Camera must have a CinemachineBrain
    /// behaviour, which will select the most eligible virtual camera based on its priority
    /// or on other criteria, and will manage blending.
